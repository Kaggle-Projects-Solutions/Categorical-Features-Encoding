### Introduction
A common task in machine learning pipelines is encoding categorical variables for a given algorithm in a format that allows as much useful signal as possible to be captured.

This project focuses on categorical features only, and includes:

 - binary features
 - low- and high-cardinality nominal features
 - low- and high-cardinality ordinal features
 - (potentially) cyclical features
<br><br/>


### Targets

 1. Explore techniques for categorical features encoding
